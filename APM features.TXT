With APM you can automatically collect detailed performance information from inside your service with only minor changes 
to your code. For example APM agents can measure the response time for incoming requests, time spent in database queries,
calls to caches, external HTTP requests, etc. This makes it easier to pinpoint and fix performance problems quickly.

The agents hook into your service and start collecting performance metrics and errors once it starts.
